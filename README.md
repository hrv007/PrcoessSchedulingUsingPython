# PrcoessSchedulingUsingPython
The code contains the simulation of a few of the basic process scheduling algorithms implemented using python. The simulation created has been made interactive and is created using the tKinter library available as a python package.
Once the user enters the main screen, one can see multiple process scheduling algorithms enlisted. Type the number of processes for which process scheduling needs to be carried out and then click on the process scheduling algorithm one wants to operate upon.
The code will open another window and dynamically create space for the number of processes desired by the user on the new window. Enter the required details such as name of the process, burst time etc.
Once the user fills in the details, click on 'Go' button and the user will be able to see the schedule as per which the processes will be carried out.
Additionally, the user will be able to see a tabular structure where the completion time, turnaround time and waiting time of every single process has been listed down.
Moreover, average turnaround time and average waiting will be displayed which are generally used for comparing the working of different process scheduling algorithms.

This interactive GUI is good for those who are just starting with the concepts of process scheduling and can help in getting a gist of how the processes will be carried out and which one performs better in what cases.
